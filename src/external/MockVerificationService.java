/**
 * A mock Verification Service Provider implementation for testing.
 * This does not communicate with any real verification API, just uses local
 * user data to simulate one.
 *
 * All this mock service does is check if the provided business number if of the
 * appropriate length (which for our
 * purposes we will assume is 10 numbers/characters). In practice, the real
 * verification API will look up the number
 * in a database of numbers (which we don't have access to). As such, it's fine
 * if the mock implementation can
 * simulate both outcomes to check if our system can handle them.
